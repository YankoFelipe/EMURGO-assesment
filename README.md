This repository contains the JavaScript code that solves the following problems

c) You have an array of characters (string) that may be '1', '0' o '*'. e.g. 10*00*0. The
program needs to generate an output of all the possible combinations by replacing * with
an 0 and 1. I.e. input> 10**0 output> 10000, 10010, 10100, 10110. Input > *0 output >
00, 10.

While your program will take longer to run based on the number of possible combinations,
your program shouldn't crash (or hang) on an input with many Xs. Or explain how you
technically would approach this further.

What is the big 0 notation for your program?

d) You have an array of lists e.g.; [[1,3], ['a'], [4,5]]. We would like to obtain all the
permutations between the lists. The answer for this example is: (1,a,4) (1,a,5) (3,a,4)
(3,a,5). Code a program that does this for any quantity of lists and elements on them.
